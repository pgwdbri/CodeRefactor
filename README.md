# CodeRefactor

In this project, I edited existing source code for a site in order to meet accessibility standards and optimize for search engines. The edits applied to the source document included adding semantic HTML elements, condensing existing code, adding alt attributes to images, editing the title of the webpage, and organizing the structure of the overall source code.
